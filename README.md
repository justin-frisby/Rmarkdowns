# Rmarkdowns

In this repo you will find two files from one of my data science assignments. Github doesn't handle .html files well so I included the .Rmd file as well. For this assignment, we were tasked with re-creating an analysis from a publication using publically available data. Once we recreated the analysis, we then had to see if we could create a "better" model and compare the results. For all of my data science classes, we are required to submit our work via .html files generated through R markdown so I feel very comfortable working with them. Looking back at this assignment, I definitely could have documented a bit more and added some more headline sections to pivot through. In a professional setting I would for sure take those additional steps to improve the readability and useability.
